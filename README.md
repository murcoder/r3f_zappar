The project has been set up to use webpack for bundling assets and code. To get started, install the project's dependencies by running the following command:
```
npm install
```

During development, you can use the following command to run a `webpack server` for testing on your computer or a device on your local network:
```
npm run start
```

And when you're ready to publish your site, run the following command. The resulting `dist` folder can be uploaded to ZapWorks for publishing. If you'd like to self-host your site, be sure to check out the documentation on the [Zappar for React Three Fiber](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zappar/zappar-react-three-fiber) page.
```
npm run build
```
